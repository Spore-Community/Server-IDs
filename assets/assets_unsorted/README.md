# Unsorted Asset IDs
In this directory, place text files with lists of asset IDs that have *not* been organized into the correct directory structure.

These IDs can be auto-sorted into the correct location using the sort_ids.sh bash script.

The files do not need to be named in any particular way, they just need to be plain text (txt) files with one ID per line. There should be no other text on lines with IDs. Lines containing any text or other characters will be skipped.
